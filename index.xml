      <description>After perusing through the data is beautiful thread the first thing that caught my eye were all the stunning graphs that people created. For example i came across a visual of united states that showed where each state placed based on per capita per sales of different alcoholic beverages. I was shocked to see that new Hampshire was the top five if nor first place for all of them. I would assume though they raked the states by proportions not by just sheer amount.</description>

      <description>The begining of every data prowl begins with some pretty graphs. In order to understand the data, to its fullest, univariate and bivariate graphs are a great way to go about that. A univariate graph or a graph expressing only a single variable tells the story of the single graph. Answering several important quetions. Is it normally distrubited? Do the numbers/levels make sense? What do i need to fix/change and so on.</description>
