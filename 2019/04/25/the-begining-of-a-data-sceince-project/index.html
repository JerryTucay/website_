<p>The beginning of every data prowl begins with some pretty graphs. In order to understand the data, to its fullest, uni variate and bivariate graphs are a great way to go about that. A univariate graph or a graph expressing only a single variable tells the story of the single graph. Answering several important questions. Is it normally distributed? Do the numbers/levels make sense? What do i need to fix/change and so on. A bivariate graph is a way to explore the relationships between two different variables. As a data scientist we need to understand how the variables interact or whether they interact at all. Now enough chit chat lets get to the fun.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-04-25-the-begining-of-a-data-sceince-project_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /> The local topics graph has a range of .06 to .85 and is fairly normally distributed with a good amount of variation. The mean ratio here is .45 seen in red.</p>
<p>The opposing posts graph has a much larger spread ranging from 0 to .74 with a longer right tail giving it that clear right skew. The median ratio is .09 seen in green.</p>
<p>The political party graph shows the amount of people in either the democratic party or republican party. In this study there were 475 Democrats and 593 Republicans.</p>

<p>The correlation between opposing posts and local posts has a moderate negative correlation of 0.62</p>
